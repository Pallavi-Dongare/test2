Dropped support for PostgreSQL 9.4 / Oracle

Django 3.0 supports Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 (as of 3.0.11). We highly recommend and only officially support the latest release of each series.
The Django 2.2.x series is the last to support Python 3.5.	

1. support MariaDB 10.1 and higher
2. Asynchronous view and middleware support
3. In older version JSONField only support Postgress Database, but in 3.X it Support all database backend
4. DEFAULT_HASHING _ALGORATHIM setting
5. Exclusive Constraints on PostgreSQL: 
	The new ExclusionConstraint class enable adding exclusion constraints on PostgreSQL. 
	Constraints are added to models using the Meta.constraints option.
6. Filter Expression:
	Expressions that output BooleanField may now be used directly in QuerySet filters, 
	without having to first annotate and then filter against the annotation.
7. Enumeration for model choice
Custom enumeration types TextChoices, IntegerChoices, and Choices are now available as a way to define Field.choices. 
TextChoices and IntegerChoices types are provided for text and integer fields. The Choices class allows defining a 
compatible enumeration for other concrete data types. These custom enumeration types support human-readable labels 
that can be translated and accessed via a property on the enumeration or its members. See Enumeration types for more 
details and examples.
8. ASGI support¶
	Django 3.0 begins our journey to making Django fully async-capable by providing support for running as an ASGI application.

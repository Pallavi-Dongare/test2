difference between Git and Github -->

1. Github is a cloud server on which we store our application code
2. Git is a Software and It is an interface through which we communicate with Github Server.


stepts --> 

1. login to your Github account and create a repository  --> This repository is called Remote repository(Master)

1. nevigate to the location of file in cmd
	C:\Users\HP\PycharmProjects\online\demos
	
2. write a command 'git init' --> initialize a particular repository to this location	
	It creates '.git' repository to this location.  --> This repository is called Local repository
	
	C:\Users\HP\PycharmProjects\online\demos>git init
	Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/HP/PycharmProjects/online/demos/.git/
	
The repository on Github is called Remote repository and repository at the file location is called Local repository.	
	

3. then specify the user name who commit the code to the Master repository(Remote)

		git config --global user.name "Pallavi"
		
4.then specify the email of that user

		git config --global user.email "dongarepallavi1996@gmail.com"
		

5.this command add all the files from demos and that files are ready to commit

	-->git add -A	
	--> git add .  --> it add the direcory

6.command to chech the git status -->  git status	


when new file is creted it is  --> untracked/unmodified
when we made changes in that file then it is --> Modified
when we add files by git add . or get add -A  --> Modified and inside stage area 
												and the files which are in only staging area are ready to commit.
												Not all files are commit to local repository. only files in staging are
												are ready to commit

all the above process in our IDE/Pycharm

our IDE and local repository is present in one machine


git rm --cached a  --> this command is used to get file in untracked/unmodified  --> remove from stage area

git restore sample.py  --> This command remove the latest change in modified file from working copy(from IDE)(not after commit or before adding the file) 

git restore --staged sample.py   --> this command is used to remove latest change from staging area(after add)

7. To push the code into a local repository we have to commit it.

	git commit -m "Initial Commit"  --> it push the code from IDE to local repository
										-m is the message "Initial Commit"

	
	git commit -m "Second commit"   --> commit second time
	
	
	git log  --> It shows all commit


	git reset HEAD~  --> It remove the changes from local repository(after commit) --> get back from local repository to modified


				IDE     				.Git  (git init --> to create local repository)

	untracked   Modified   Stage		(Local repository)
	
	Newly 
	created		  
	file		  
	
	  ----------------------->
			git add .
			git add -A
	
	 ------------->		
	add some data to 
	file						git commit
							------------------->	
						git reset HEAD~
				 <-------------------------------					
							
							
				
				
8. create new branch on Github  -->  
		
		git branch -M main  (main is branch name)	

		git remote add origin https://github.com/pallavi22-dongare/gitsample.git   --> and call this repository
		
		
		git push -u origin main  --> push the code in master(remote repository)
		
		
		git branch --> list all the branches
		
		
		git branch -d xxx  --> delete branch name xxx  --> deleting a branch locally
		
		
		git checkout branch_name--> switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
